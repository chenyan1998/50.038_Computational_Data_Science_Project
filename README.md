## Hit Song Prediction
When we listen to songs, despite the different taste in music, one can more or less deduce whether a song will be popular. However, rather than using our intuition or "gut-feeling" to predict hit songs, the purpose of the project is to see if we can use intrinsic music data to identify Hit songs by machine learning.
